Why did the penguin cross the road twice?

> To prove he wasn’t chicken.

## Intro

Today I am going to show you some cool methods visualize quantative and qualitative data in unique ways. Without further ado, lets get into it!

### ☃1
For our example today, we are going to be using the **Palmer Penguins** dataset created by Dr. Kristen Gorman. So first, we must import the modules we are going to use and the dataset itself.  
``` python
import pandas as pd
from plotly import express as px
from plotly.io import write_html

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```
&nbsp; 

Now that we have the modules and data properly imported, lets take a look at our data!
For clarity purposes, we will be using the [plotly module](https://plotly.com/python) for all visualizations.  

``` python
fig = px.histogram(data_frame = penguins, # data that needs to be plotted
                 x = "Sex", # must include col name from data_frame
                 color = "Species", #seperates diff individuals by their species grouping using color
                 width = 800,
                 height = 200)

# change margins
fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":0,"l":0,"b":0})
fig.show()
```

{% include precleaned.html %}

As seen above, we can see that the penguins data is not clean, and has invalid values inside the set. To properly visualize the valid data, lets clean up the dataframe.  

``` python
penguins = penguins.dropna(subset = ["Body Mass (g)", "Sex"]) #gets rid of NA vals
penguins["Species"] = penguins["Species"].str.split().str.get(0) #shortens species names
penguins = penguins[penguins["Sex"] != "."] #takes out the pesky "."

cols = ["Species", "Island", "Sex", "Culmen Length (mm)", "Culmen Depth (mm)", "Flipper Length (mm)", "Body Mass (g)"] 
penguins = penguins[cols] #setting dataframe cols we want to look at
```

## Time to Graph!

### ☃1

Lets first look at some qualitative data about our penguins using an Alluvial diagram.

``` python
colors = {"Adelie"    : "#EDE65E ",
         "Chinstrap" : "#42FF8A",
          "Gentoo"    : "#E8A1F8"}
#These are custom colors, you can customize the hex codes as desired in your code

color_hex = penguins["Species"].map(colors)
#color_hex .map() creates a Series that mirrors the input, so color_hex reflects 
#penguins["Species"] but replaces the species name with a color code

fig = px.parallel_categories(penguins,
                             dimensions = ["Species", "Island", "Sex"], # order of columns on graph
                             color = color_hex, #usage of color_hex
                             height = 300)

fig.update_layout(margin={"r":20,"t":0,"l":20,"b":0})
fig.show()
```
{% include alluvial_penguins.html %}

From the diagram, we can get some pretty important insights on the relationships of the descriptive statistics of the penguins sample. Looking at the center bars of the diagram, *which display the islands in the dataset*, the diagram gives us a clear picture of where certain species of penguins prefer to live on.

### ☃2

If we want to compare the quantative data in our dataset, we have a variety of different diagrams and graphs we can use in the plotly module. Lets compare the body mass, culmen length, and culmen depth of our penguins using a 3d scatterplot.

``` python
colorz = ["#EDE65E","#42FF8A","#E8A1F8"]

fig = px.scatter_3d(penguins,
                    x = "Body Mass (g)",
                    y = "Culmen Length (mm)",
                    z = "Culmen Depth (mm)",
                    color = "Species", #need to specify for seperation in the graph
                    color_discrete_sequence = colorz, #required to get custom colors
                    opacity = 0.5 #changes transparency of datapoints
                    )

fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":0,"l":0,"b":0})
fig.show()
```
