## Overview 

UNDERSTANDING A RESUME BUILDER 
An online resume builder. It is a webapp developed to simplify the task of creating a resume for individuals, providing effective means of designing a professional looking resume. The webapp is especially designed for individuals who have a hard time creating their resume such as graduate students. This way, they will get a clear idea of the sections and information that should be included in a resume. The system is pretty simple without too much flexibility but can be expanded to include different templates, sections and so on. This project is user-friendly and requires minimum human intervention. Individuals just have to fill up a form that specifies questions from all required fields such as personal questions, educational, experience and skills. The answers provided by the users are stored and the system automatically generates a well structured resume.

OVERVIEW OF RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM 
The webapp also provides a site to input the preferred job title and location in order to generate the top job postings on [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/). This way, the user can immediately start applying to job right after building their resume. 

The webapp is built on three main components: An Indeed Scraper, Flask Webapp, and HTML and CSS Files.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:
- Programming Language: Python
