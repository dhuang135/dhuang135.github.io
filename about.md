Hi! 

My name is Daniel Huang, welcome to my site.

I graduated in December of 2022 with a Bachelors in Psychology with a Specialization in Computing!

This website functions as a 'collage' of projects and guides of data science, analysis, and general coding. 

My Linkedin, email, and other ways to contact me are located at the bottom of the page. 

## More information

Attached is a photo of Oreo, my Norwegian Forest cat mix, alongside my favorite bear and I. Go Bruins!
